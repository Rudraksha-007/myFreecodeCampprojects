                "White Humanoids," "White People," or "White Humans" ("白いヒトガタ," often shortened to simply "ヒトガタ,"
                "Hitogata") is an urban legend dating back to 2004 on the anonymous Japanese message board website 2ch.
                Users believe that this piece of media is either a PSA shown in schools or a commercial that aired late
                at night. Testimonies and eyewitness accounts vary, but the general premise stays the same: The sound of
                a railroad crossing sign rings in the background, as two white, featureless human figures appear on the
                screen. When one figure fades out, another fades in. Text is displayed on the screen, with some reports
                of a narrator saying that: Every two seconds, someone dies on the Earth (time varies between eyewitness
                accounts). <br>Originating in 2004, numerous recreation videos have been made depicting these two white,
                featureless figures. Despite numerous search efforts, the commercial has not been found and still
                remains an urban legend.

                In 2004, on the anonymous message board 2channel, a thread was made about a series of creepy commercials
                and advertisements that users had found memorable. In this thread, the origins of the myth would come to
                fruition. The original post, in Japanese, reads as such:

                have it constantly left in my memory. There were two white human figures depicted against a black
                backdrop, and this noise going "Kan-kan" kept ringing. What's sure is the part that went "Every two
                seconds, a man dies on Earth", and when the noise is repeated again, the other figure disappears. In the
                next instant, the human figure returns back to its original place, and now the other one disappears. It
                was a commercial with only that repeating over and over."

                Due to the vague nature of the testimonial, it has been difficult for those searching to find
                "hitogata." However, this has not put a stop to numerous search efforts.

                Testimonies and eyewitness accounts vary between users who claim to have seen "hitogata." Some sources
                state that there was a railroad crossing sign present, with a sepia-coloured background. Other sources
                claim that there was no railroad crossing sign, and the background was black.[2] Sightings range from
                the 1990s to the 2000s, although a time frame of 1996-2003 has been narrowed down.

                One eyewitness account comes from a post made on 2ch in 1999. However, an archive of the original thread
