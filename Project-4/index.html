                        Step up your game, you mid-tier plebeians! For $4,999, the Pro Plan is for those of you who‚Äôve
                        got a bit more cash to burn but are still too stingy to go full luxury. This plan is for the
                        wannabe time-travelers who want to pretend they have taste without breaking the bank. You'll get
                        a round-trip ticket and some cushy upgrades, like smoother rides and access to fancier time

                        unlimited jumps in 24 hours, VIP treatment, and access to the swankiest eras‚Äîbecause obviously,
                        you're too good to mingle with the commoners.

            <p>
                Hey there, DeLorean adventurers! We‚Äôve noticed some of you have been time-traveling straight to our web
                developers' inboxes with complaints about our site. Sure, our website might load slower than dial-up on
                a bad day and have more bugs than a Jurassic swamp, but harassing our devs isn‚Äôt the answer! They‚Äôre
                working hard to improve it while juggling the complexities of time travel, quantum physics, and keeping
                our servers from imploding.

                So, cut them some slack! Your fiery emails and cranky comments are only slowing down the process.
                Instead, how about you grab a coffee, take a deep breath, and trust us‚Äîwe‚Äôll have things back on track
                faster than you can say ‚ÄúEinstein-Rosen Bridge.‚Äù In the meantime, if you need help, just contact our
                stellar support team‚Äîthey‚Äôre more responsive than a DeLorean with a flux capacitor upgrade. Thanks for
                your patience and understanding!
            </p>
