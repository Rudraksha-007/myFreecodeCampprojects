                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                    leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                    with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                    publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                    "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single
                    website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to
                    the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant
                    in the World Wide Web.
                    HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser.
                    HTML markup includes special "elements" such as :
                </p>
                <div class="codebox">
                    <code>
                        &lt;head&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;,lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &limg&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;audio&gt;, &lt;canvas&gt;, &lt;datalist&gt;, &ldetails&gt;, &lt;embed&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;search&gt;, &lt;output&gt;, &lprogress&gt;, &lt;video&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;li&gt;
